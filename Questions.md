##Lecture 2
### Test yourself:
 - What is a reference?
 A reference is defined with the & and should be initialized at declaration. It is like an alians to variable.
 - What is a difference between passing variables to functions by reference and by value?
 If you pass by reference the modification outside the function are still present. 
 - Why do we want to pass variables to functions by reference rather than by pointer?
 - If the function accepts pointers (signature `int function(int* a)`), how do you pass a variable defined as `int x` to it?
 - Why do we want to use `const` modifier whenever possible?
 - If you have a pointer named `p`, how do you access a value it points to? What is the name of that process?
 - What value is stored in the pointer variable itself?
 - What can you say about a function that has signature `void function()`?
 - What is an `auto` keyword?
 - What is function overloading?
 - What is a recursive function?
 - What is the role of a constructor in a class?
 - How can we change private member variables of a class?
